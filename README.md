# Generative-Synth

This is my attempt to make a generative synth in Pure Data. The patch allows users to make generative compositions when a MIDI file is loaded in the patch. The algorithms follow a markov chain theory to determine the random sequence the notes will play in. Funtions that allows users to alter tempo, pitch and note duration will be added and sound modulating controls like distortion, delay, note attack, note decay and filter parameters will be made also.
